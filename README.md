## Thoughts:

I really enjoyed this course, I thought it gave a great introduction to OOP in python as it was very easy to follow along and see what they were doing. The way they provided you with challenges and then gave examaple solutions was very useful and engaging. They also provided ways to extend your game past what they have done. However it was quite brief so I think I need to do another project/course on OOP in python especially as there was only one small project example. Other than that I thoroughly enjoyed this course and the project it provided.

## Takeaways:

I already knew the basics of OOP in python so it wasn't a really steep learning curve with loads of new terms but here are some of the things I did learn that I didn't know already:
- Inheritance: a class is able to use all of the attributes and methods from a superclass.
- Polymorphism: when a method behaves differently depending on which object it belongs too.
- Aggregation: when an object contains an instance of another object.
